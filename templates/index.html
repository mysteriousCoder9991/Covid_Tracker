   <h1 class="container my-3">What is Covid-19?</h1>
   <p class="container my-3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
   font-size: 15px;color:black;">
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified in <b>December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China</b>, and has
      resulted in an ongoing pandemic.
      The first confirmed case has been traced back to <strong>17 November 2019 in Hubei.</strong> As of 5 July 2020,
      more than 11.1
      million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 528,000 deaths. More
      than 6.03 million people have recovered.<br>
      Common symptoms include:
   <ul style="color: red; font-size: 15px;">
      <li>fever</li>
      <li>cough</li>
      <li>fatigue</li>
      <li>shortness of breath</li>
      <li>loss of smell and taste.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   <p class="container my-3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
   font-size: 15px;color:black">
      While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, <strong>some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome
         (ARDS)
         possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.</strong>The
      time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen
      days.<br>

      The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact most often
   <ol type="A" style="color: red; font-size: 15px;">
      <li>via small droplets produced by coughing</li>
      <li>sneezing, and talking.</li>
   </ol>
   <p class="container my-3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
   font-size: 15px;color:black">
      The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather
      than travelling through air over long distances. However, research as of June 2020 has shown that
      speech-generated droplets may remain airborne for tens of minutes. Less commonly, people may become infected
      by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. It is most contagious during the first
      three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do
      not show symptoms.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in
      individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines
      do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.<br>

   <p class="container my-3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
   font-size: 15px;color:black">

      Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others
      (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and
      keeping unwashed hands away from the face.The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana
      has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some
      authorities requiring their use.Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95
      masks, should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected
      individuals.<br>

      There are no vaccines nor specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19.[6] Management involves the treatment of
      symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.[33] The World Health Organization (WHO) declared
      the COVIDâ€‘19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)[34][35] on 30 January 2020 and a
      pandemic on 11 March 2020.[Local transmission of the disease has occurred in most countries across all six WHO
      regions.
